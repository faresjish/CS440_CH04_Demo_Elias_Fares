 I picked the MIT Permission where people can use it for free of,and  any person can obtain a copy they can be crative and bulid on my platform and Additionally the MIT License can just be copied and pasted as is while the BSD license requires editing it from project to project. So I Personally  like MIT , I am not losing much by picking the MIT license for my project.
